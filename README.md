# Generative Quantum Machine Learning using Python and Q#

In this tutorial, we'll use a Jupyter notebook to implement Data-driven Quantum Circuit Learning (DDQCL), based on the 2019 paper [Training of quantum circuits on a hybrid quantum computer](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw9918) by Zhu et. al.

## Prerequisites

 - Azure Quantum Workspace
 - Python 3.7+
 - IQ#
 - A few helpful packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `noisyopt`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `jupyterlab`

## Getting started

Download, install prerequisites, and just run the Jupyter notebook in the `src/` directory!
